# Mobile Libaries Database

This is the database for the [mobile libraries project](https://blog.librarydata.uk/mobile-library-data-project). The database is developed using PostgreSQL and PostGIS.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

To get this database up and running you'll need a PostgreSQL Server, version 10. With a compatible PostGIS installed.

### Installing

To get the database up and running, following through the steps in the create.sql file, this can be done directly on the local database using a tool such as [PGAdmin 4](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/).

## Deployment

On a live system it is more likely you will need to remotely run the create.sql script. In a Windows environment a sample of doing this is included in the create.bat file.
